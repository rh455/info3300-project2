Current issues:

Mouseover works on satellites sthat are currently transparent. Can we have mouseover only work for currently opaque satellites?
What does validGEO do?
FilterBy and updateSatelliteYear don't pull data from each other. Can we refactor the two into one filter function?
What is satData doing?
Need to add more data to mouseover.
I think we need to remove satellites on exit(), since we keep appending more paths.
Change stars to satellites.
